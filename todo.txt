To integrate frontend with the backend, priority:

Implement filter in customer order items screen.

Begin Authorization implementation after all other to-do tasks completed.

Authorization {
	Add admin user.

	Seed him using sign-up-admin function.
	
	Give him the power to add new items to the menu.

	Give him the power to add new users(waiters, receptionists, and lyf-staff)
}

After authorization - edge cases{

	Add billing page:
		Generate the bill(Save as .pdf)
	
	no pdf library exists for reading an ionic component render into react for 

	refresh causes waitlist to be emptied: do one of two things ->

	1) Store waitlist in localstorage(fails if machine shuts down in between)

	2) Store waitlist as table in backend(must implement cronjob that clears that at every opening)
}

After handling edge cases, begin improvements on the css such that it looks good.
