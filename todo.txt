To integrate frontend with the backend, priority:

Begin Authorization implementation.

Authorization {
	Seed him using sign-up-admin function.
	
	Give him the power to add new items to the menu.

	Give him the power to add new users(waiters, receptionists, and lyf-staff)
}

After authorization - edge cases{
	Implement filter in customer order items screen.
	refresh causes waitlist to be emptied: do one of two things ->

	1) Store waitlist in localstorage(fails if machine shuts down in between)

	2) Store waitlist as table in backend(must implement cronjob that clears that at every opening)
}

After handling edge cases, begin improvements on the css such that it looks good.

Note: bill generation has been handled keeping the restaurant hardware in mind. The json generated from the bill will be sent to the bill priting machine/service which will then process the json and print out the bill.
