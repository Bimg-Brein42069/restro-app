To integrate frontend with the backend, priority:

Add billing page:
	Generate the bill(Save as .pdf)

Implement filter in customer order items screen.

Implement protection in table-booking method such that booking size cannot exceed max table size, else ask them to split.

Begin Authorization implementation after all other to-do tasks completed.

After authorization - edge cases{
	refresh causes waitlist to be emptied: do one of two things ->

	1) Store waitlist in localstorage(fails if machine shuts down in between)

	2) Store waitlist as table in backend(must implement cronjob that clears that at every opening)
}

After handling edge cases, begin improvements on the css such that it looks good.
